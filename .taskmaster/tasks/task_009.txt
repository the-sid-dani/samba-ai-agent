# Task ID: 9
# Title: Optimize Vector Search Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure and optimize Vespa for technical documentation search by adjusting search weights, chunk sizes, and retrieval parameters.
# Details:
1. Modify `backend/onyx/configs/app_configs.py`
2. Set HYBRID_SEARCH_WEIGHT_MODIFIER = 0.7 to favor semantic search
3. Configure CHUNK_SIZE = 512 for main chunks
4. Set MINI_CHUNK_SIZE = 128 for smaller chunks
5. Adjust TOP_K_CHUNKS = 10 for retrieval
6. Update Vespa schema for technical documentation
7. Implement hybrid search configuration
8. Set up reranking for improved results
9. Optimize for sub-second query times

# Test Strategy:
1. Test search performance with technical queries
2. Measure query response times
3. Verify hybrid search works correctly
4. Test reranking improves result quality
5. Benchmark performance with different chunk sizes
6. Verify sub-second query times are achieved

# Subtasks:
## 1. Review and Update Configuration Files [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and update relevant configuration files to reflect new settings for search, chunking, schema, and hybrid search.
### Details:
Locate all configuration files related to the search system. Document current settings and prepare for changes required by subsequent subtasks.

## 2. Tune Search Weights [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Adjust search weight parameters to optimize relevance and ranking of search results.
### Details:
Analyze current search weight settings, experiment with new values, and document the impact on search result quality.

## 3. Adjust Chunk Size Parameters [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Modify chunk size settings to balance indexing speed, search latency, and resource usage.
### Details:
Determine optimal chunk size based on data volume and system performance. Update configuration files accordingly.

## 4. Update Data Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Revise the data schema to support new search features, improved indexing, or hybrid search requirements.
### Details:
Analyze current schema, identify necessary changes, and implement updates to support enhanced search capabilities.

## 5. Set Up Hybrid Search [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Configure the system to support hybrid search, combining multiple search strategies (e.g., keyword and semantic search).
### Details:
Integrate hybrid search logic into the system, update configuration files, and ensure compatibility with existing features.

## 6. Implement Reranking Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.5
### Description: Add or update reranking logic to improve the ordering of search results based on relevance or other criteria.
### Details:
Develop or configure reranking algorithms, test their impact on search quality, and integrate them into the search pipeline.

## 7. Optimize Search Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Apply performance optimization techniques to reduce search latency and resource consumption.
### Details:
Profile the search system, identify bottlenecks, and implement optimizations such as query restructuring, parallelization, or index tuning.

## 8. Benchmark Search System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and execute benchmarks to measure search accuracy, speed, and resource usage before and after optimizations.
### Details:
Develop benchmarking scripts, collect metrics, and compare results to validate improvements.

## 9. Document Changes and Results [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Compile documentation detailing configuration updates, tuning decisions, schema changes, optimization steps, and benchmarking outcomes.
### Details:
Ensure all changes are well-documented for future reference and reproducibility.
