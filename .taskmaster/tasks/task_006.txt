# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Confluence Document Ingestion
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the Confluence sync functionality to perform initial full sync and incremental updates of selected spaces, extracting page content, comments, and metadata.
# Details:
1. Modify `backend/onyx/connectors/confluence/connector.py` and `backend/onyx/background/indexing/job_supervisor.py`
2. Implement full sync functionality for selected Confluence spaces
3. Set up incremental updates to run every 10 minutes
4. Extract page content, comments, and attachments
5. Preserve metadata including author, date, and space
6. Implement chunking strategy for large pages
7. Add configuration for space selection
8. Set up proper error handling and retry logic

# Test Strategy:
1. Test full sync with a test Confluence space
2. Verify documents are properly indexed in Vespa
3. Test incremental sync by making changes to Confluence pages
4. Confirm search returns Confluence results
5. Verify metadata is preserved correctly
6. Test error handling with invalid spaces

# Subtasks:
## 1. Update Connector Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Revise and enhance the connector to support new data sources, improved extraction, and compatibility with updated job supervisor logic.
### Details:
Ensure the connector can handle both full and incremental syncs, extract content and metadata, and interface with error handling mechanisms.

## 2. Update Job Supervisor [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Modify the job supervisor to orchestrate sync operations, manage task scheduling, and monitor job statuses.
### Details:
Integrate with updated connector logic and ensure robust tracking of sync jobs, including error reporting and recovery.

## 3. Implement Full Sync Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Develop logic to perform a complete data sync from source to destination, ensuring all content and metadata are ingested.
### Details:
Handle large data volumes efficiently and ensure data integrity throughout the process.

## 4. Implement Incremental Sync Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Create mechanisms to detect and ingest only new or changed data since the last sync, minimizing resource usage.
### Details:
Ensure incremental syncs preserve consistency and handle edge cases such as deletions or updates.

## 5. Content Extraction Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Develop a module to extract relevant content from ingested data, preparing it for downstream processing.
### Details:
Support various data formats and ensure extracted content is structured for chunking and storage.

## 6. Metadata Preservation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.5
### Description: Ensure all relevant metadata is captured and stored alongside content during both full and incremental syncs.
### Details:
Design data models and storage strategies to maintain metadata integrity and accessibility.

## 7. Chunking and Space Selection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement logic to divide extracted content into manageable chunks and select appropriate storage spaces.
### Details:
Optimize chunk sizes for processing and retrieval, and ensure space selection aligns with data governance policies.

## 8. Error Handling and Recovery [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop comprehensive error detection, logging, and recovery mechanisms across all pipeline stages.
### Details:
Ensure the system can gracefully handle failures, retry operations, and provide actionable error reports.
