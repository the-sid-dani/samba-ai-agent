# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Google Drive Document Processing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the Google Drive sync functionality to process different document types, implement folder-based selection, and handle permissions and real-time updates.
# Details:
1. Modify `backend/onyx/connectors/google_drive/connector.py`
2. Implement document processing for:
   - Google Docs → Markdown conversion
   - Google Sheets → Structured data extraction
   - PDFs → Text extraction
   - Google Slides → Content + notes extraction
3. Set up folder-based selection mechanism
4. Implement permission mirroring
5. Configure real-time updates via push notifications
6. Add incremental sync functionality
7. Implement proper error handling and retry logic

# Test Strategy:
1. Test syncing a test folder with various document types
2. Verify all document types are processed correctly
3. Confirm permissions are respected in search results
4. Test that Drive results appear in search
5. Verify real-time updates work when documents change
6. Test error handling with invalid documents

# Subtasks:
## 1. Plan and Execute Connector Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review current connector versions, schedule updates, and ensure all connectors are upgraded to the latest supported version with minimal downtime.
### Details:
Coordinate with stakeholders, follow vendor-specific update procedures, and verify successful completion of updates.

## 2. Identify and Catalog Document Types [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: List all document types to be processed by the connector, including their formats and any special handling requirements.
### Details:
Gather requirements from business users and technical documentation to ensure comprehensive coverage.

## 3. Implement Document Type Processing Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Develop and update connector logic to correctly process each identified document type, ensuring compatibility and data integrity.
### Details:
Include parsing, validation, and transformation steps as needed for each document type.

## 4. Develop Folder Selection Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Design and implement a user interface or configuration method for selecting which folders the connector should process.
### Details:
Support recursive selection, exclusion rules, and dynamic folder discovery if required.

## 5. Implement Permission Mirroring [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Ensure that the connector accurately mirrors source folder and document permissions to the target system.
### Details:
Map permission models between systems, handle inheritance, and test edge cases.

## 6. Integrate Push Notification Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.5
### Description: Add real-time push notification capabilities to inform users or systems of changes, updates, or errors.
### Details:
Leverage existing notification frameworks or implement custom notification logic as needed.

## 7. Enable Incremental Synchronization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement logic to detect and process only changes since the last sync, optimizing performance and reducing resource usage.
### Details:
Track sync state, handle deletions, updates, and new items efficiently.

## 8. Develop Robust Error Handling and Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design comprehensive error handling mechanisms and create a thorough testing plan covering all features and edge cases.
### Details:
Include automated tests, manual test cases, and monitoring for production deployments.
