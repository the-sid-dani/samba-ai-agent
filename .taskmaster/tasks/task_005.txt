# Task ID: 5
# Title: Set Up Confluence API Authentication
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure Confluence API access by implementing token-based authentication for the SambaTv Confluence instance.
# Details:
1. Modify `backend/onyx/connectors/confluence/connector.py`
2. Implement API Token authentication flow
3. Configure base URL to use https://sambatv.atlassian.net/wiki
4. Set up cloud instance settings
5. Add secure token storage mechanism
6. Implement test function to verify connectivity
7. Add configuration options to .env file:
   - CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN=xxx
   - CONFLUENCE_USERNAME=xxx@sambatv.com

# Test Strategy:
1. Generate a test API token in Atlassian
2. Verify the connector authenticates successfully
3. Test listing accessible spaces
4. Confirm token is stored securely (not in logs)
5. Test error handling for invalid credentials

# Subtasks:
## 1. Modify Connector for Token Authentication [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update the existing connector code to support token-based authentication, ensuring that authentication logic is encapsulated and reusable.
### Details:
Refactor the connector to accept and use tokens for API requests, following best practices for modularity and error handling.

## 2. Implement Base URL Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Set up the connector to use a configurable base URL for API endpoints, avoiding hardcoded values.
### Details:
Allow the base URL to be set via configuration or environment variables to support different environments and API versions.

## 3. Configure Secure Token Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Establish a secure method for storing and retrieving authentication tokens, minimizing exposure to security risks.
### Details:
Use environment variables or a secure vault to store tokens, ensuring they are not exposed in code or logs.

## 4. Set Up .env Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Create or update a .env file to manage sensitive configuration values such as tokens and base URLs.
### Details:
Document required environment variables and ensure the connector reads from the .env file at runtime.

## 5. Test API Connectivity and Authentication [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Verify that the connector can successfully authenticate and connect to the API using the configured token and base URL.
### Details:
Perform integration tests to ensure the connector handles authentication, connectivity, and error scenarios robustly.

## 6. Review and Harden Security Measures [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.5
### Description: Audit the connector for security best practices, focusing on token handling, error logging, and configuration management.
### Details:
Ensure no sensitive data is logged, tokens are securely managed, and the connector is resilient to common security threats.
