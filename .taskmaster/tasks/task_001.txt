# Task ID: 1
# Title: Fork and Rebrand Onyx Repository
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create SambaAI from Onyx v0.29.1 fork by replacing all references to 'Onyx' and 'DanswerBot' with 'SambaAI', updating logo files, Docker image names, and Python package names.
# Details:
1. Fork the Onyx v0.29.1 repository
2. Perform global find/replace:
   - 'Onyx' → 'SambaAI'
   - 'DanswerBot' → 'SambaAI'
3. Replace logo files in `web/public/`
4. Update Docker image names in `docker-compose.dev.yml`
5. Update Python package names in `backend/setup.py`
6. Verify all references have been updated
7. Test build to ensure no breaking changes

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify no 'Onyx' or 'DanswerBot' references remain using grep

3. Run the application locally to verify branding appears correctly
4. Check package imports work correctly
