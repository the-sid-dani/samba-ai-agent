# Task ID: 15
# Title: Create AWS Infrastructure with Terraform
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 14
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop Terraform modules for GCP infrastructure to deploy SambaAI, including Compute Engine VM instances, Cloud SQL PostgreSQL, Memorystore Redis, Cloud Storage, and Secret Manager.
# Details:
1. Create `deployment/terraform/gcp/main.tf`
2. Define Compute Engine VM instances (e2-standard-4 or e2-standard-8)
3. Configure Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance
4. Set up Memorystore Redis
5. Create Cloud Storage bucket for document storage
6. Configure Secret Manager for sensitive data
7. Set up networking and firewall rules
8. Configure DNS for domain pointing to GCP external IP
9. Define IAM roles and permissions
10. Set up Let's Encrypt for SSL certificates
11. Install Docker and dependencies
12. Deploy SambaAI using Docker Compose
13. Configure monitoring and logging

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify Terraform applies cleanly
2. Test all services are healthy after deployment
3. Confirm secrets are managed properly
4. Verify Docker containers are running correctly
5. Verify networking, DNS, and SSL are configured correctly
6. Test HTTPS access to the SambaAI application
7. Verify monitoring and logging are properly configured

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Terraform Module Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the overall structure for Terraform modules, including directory layout, naming conventions, and documentation standards.
### Details:
Establish a consistent structure for all modules (e.g., variables.tf, main.tf, outputs.tf, versions.tf, README.md) and set naming/documentation guidelines to ensure maintainability and clarity.[3][5]

## 2. Implement Networking Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Create a Terraform module to provision VPC networks, subnets, routes, and firewall rules required for the GCP infrastructure.
### Details:
Ensure the networking module encapsulates all networking resources and exposes outputs for use by dependent modules (e.g., subnet IDs, VPC ID). Configure firewall rules to allow HTTPS traffic.

## 3. Develop IAM Roles and Permissions Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Create a module to manage IAM roles, permissions, and service accounts needed by Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, Memorystore, and other GCP services.
### Details:
Define least-privilege IAM roles and permissions, ensuring privilege boundaries are respected and outputs are available for other modules.[2][4]

## 4. Create Compute Engine Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.3
### Description: Develop a module to provision Google Compute Engine VM instances for SambaAI Docker-based deployment, including instance configuration and startup scripts.
### Details:
Parameterize the module for instance types (e2-standard-4 or e2-standard-8), disk size (500GB), and networking. Include startup scripts to install git, docker, and docker-compose. Ensure integration with IAM and networking modules.

## 5. Configure Cloud SQL Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.3
### Description: Build a module to provision a Google Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance, including networking configuration and security settings.
### Details:
Allow configuration of instance size, storage, and networking. Ensure outputs for connection endpoint and credentials.

## 6. Set Up Memorystore Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.3
### Description: Develop a module to provision Memorystore Redis instances, including networking configuration and security settings.
### Details:
Parameterize for Redis version, node count, and networking. Output connection endpoints.

## 7. Provision Cloud Storage Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Create a module to provision Cloud Storage buckets for application storage, backups, or logging, with appropriate policies and encryption.
### Details:
Support configuration of bucket policies, versioning, encryption, and lifecycle rules. Output bucket names and URLs.

## 8. Implement Secret Manager Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Develop a module to manage secrets in Google Secret Manager, including creation and access controls.
### Details:
Allow creation of secrets for database credentials, API keys, etc., and ensure IAM roles have appropriate access.

## 9. Configure DNS and SSL [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.4
### Description: Set up DNS configuration for domain pointing to GCP external IP and implement Let's Encrypt for SSL certificates.
### Details:
Create Terraform resources to manage DNS records and automate Let's Encrypt certificate issuance and renewal. Ensure proper integration with Compute Engine instances.

## 10. Create Docker Deployment Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.4
### Description: Develop configuration for Docker and Docker Compose deployment of SambaAI on Compute Engine instances.
### Details:
Create templates for docker-compose.yml and related configuration files. Include setup for container orchestration, networking, and volume management.

## 11. Configure Monitoring and Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.4, 15.10
### Description: Set up monitoring and logging for the SambaAI deployment on GCP.
### Details:
Implement Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging for the Compute Engine instances and SambaAI application. Configure alerts and dashboards for key metrics.

## 12. Create Deployment Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, 15.5, 15.6, 15.7, 15.8, 15.9, 15.10, 15.11
### Description: Document the deployment process for SambaAI on GCP using the Terraform modules.
### Details:
Create comprehensive documentation covering the deployment process, configuration options, and troubleshooting steps for the SambaAI GCP deployment.
