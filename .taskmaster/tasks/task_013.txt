# Task ID: 13
# Title: Optimize Docker for Production
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a production-ready Docker Compose configuration with health checks, resource limits, and proper logging setup.
# Details:
1. Create `deployment/docker_compose/docker-compose.prod.yml`
2. Remove `web_server` service for production
3. Add health checks for all services
4. Configure resource limits (CPU, memory)
5. Set up logging to persistent volumes
6. Configure environment variables for production
7. Optimize container settings for performance
8. Add restart policies for services

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify production compose file works correctly
2. Test health checks for all services
3. Confirm memory limits are enforced
4. Verify logs persist to volumes correctly
5. Test restart policies work as expected

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Production Docker Compose File [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Draft a docker-compose.yml file tailored for production, ensuring versioning and modular service definitions.
### Details:
Specify the Compose file version, define each service with clear roles, and ensure maintainability and scalability.

## 2. Remove Unnecessary Services [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Identify and remove any services from the Compose file that are not required in the production environment.
### Details:
Audit the Compose file for development-only or obsolete services and eliminate them to reduce attack surface and resource usage.

## 3. Implement Health Checks [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Add healthcheck definitions for each critical service to enable Docker to monitor and manage container health.
### Details:
Define healthcheck commands, intervals, and retries for each service to ensure reliability and automatic recovery.

## 4. Set Resource Limits [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Configure CPU and memory limits for each service to prevent resource exhaustion and ensure fair allocation.
### Details:
Use the 'deploy.resources' section to specify limits and reservations for production workloads.

## 5. Configure Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Set up logging drivers and options for each service to ensure logs are captured and managed appropriately.
### Details:
Choose suitable logging drivers (e.g., json-file, syslog) and configure log rotation and retention policies.

## 6. Set Up Environment Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Externalize environment variables and secrets using .env files or Docker secrets for secure and flexible configuration.
### Details:
Move sensitive and environment-specific values out of the Compose file, referencing them via environment variables or secrets.

## 7. Optimize Container Settings [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Review and adjust container settings for performance, security, and maintainability.
### Details:
Apply best practices such as using minimal base images, removing unnecessary packages, and enabling read-only file systems where possible.

## 8. Define Restart Policies [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Specify restart policies for each service to ensure automatic recovery from failures.
### Details:
Use the 'restart' or 'deploy.restart_policy' fields to define when and how containers should be restarted.
