# Task ID: 14
# Title: Set Up Monitoring and Observability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement monitoring using Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, and query performance tracking.
# Details:
1. Create `backend/onyx/server/metrics.py`
2. Set up Prometheus metrics for key performance indicators
3. Create `deployment/docker_compose/monitoring/` directory
4. Configure Grafana dashboards for visualization
5. Implement Slack bot analytics tracking
6. Set up query performance monitoring
7. Configure alerting for critical issues
8. Implement log storage and analysis

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify metrics are exposed on /metrics endpoint
2. Test Grafana dashboards show key metrics
3. Confirm alerts are triggered correctly
4. Verify query logs are stored properly
5. Test analytics tracking works correctly

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Metrics and Create Metrics File [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify key application and infrastructure metrics to monitor. Implement code or exporters to expose these metrics in a format compatible with Prometheus (e.g., via HTTP endpoint or file).
### Details:
Work with development teams to ensure all relevant metrics are exposed. Document metric names, types, and labels.

## 2. Set Up Prometheus Server [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Install and configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from defined targets, including the metrics file or endpoints created in the previous step.
### Details:
Download Prometheus, create a prometheus.yml configuration file specifying scrape intervals and targets, and start the Prometheus server.

## 3. Configure Monitoring Directory Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Establish a standardized directory structure for monitoring configurations, rules, and exporters to ensure maintainability and clarity.
### Details:
Organize configuration files, exporters, and scripts in a version-controlled directory. Document the structure for team reference.

## 4. Integrate Prometheus with Grafana [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2, 14.3
### Description: Install Grafana and connect it to the Prometheus data source to enable visualization of collected metrics.
### Details:
Configure Grafana to use Prometheus as a data source. Verify connectivity and data availability.

## 5. Develop Grafana Dashboards [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.4
### Description: Create Grafana dashboards to visualize key metrics, including system health, application performance, and custom analytics.
### Details:
Design and implement dashboards using Grafanaâ€™s visualization tools. Share and document dashboard URLs and configurations.

## 6. Implement Analytics Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.5
### Description: Set up analytics tracking for user interactions and system events, ensuring relevant data is captured and exposed as metrics.
### Details:
Instrument code or use third-party tools to track analytics events. Expose these as Prometheus-compatible metrics for monitoring.

## 7. Configure Query Monitoring and Alerting [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2, 14.5, 14.6
### Description: Define Prometheus alerting rules and configure Alertmanager to notify stakeholders based on metric thresholds and query results.
### Details:
Write Prometheus alerting rules (e.g., for high error rates or latency). Set up Alertmanager for notifications via email, Slack, etc.

## 8. Set Up Log Analysis Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.3, 14.5, 14.7
### Description: Integrate log analysis tools (e.g., Loki, ELK stack) with Prometheus and Grafana to correlate logs with metrics and alerts.
### Details:
Configure log shippers and parsers. Create Grafana panels to visualize and correlate logs with metric data for comprehensive monitoring.
