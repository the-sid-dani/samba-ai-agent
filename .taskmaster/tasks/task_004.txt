# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Core Slack Bot Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core bot functionality to handle mentions, process queries, and format responses with citations in the Slack interface.
# Details:
1. Modify `backend/onyx/slack/bot.py` to implement:
   - `handle_mention(event: dict)` function to process @sambaai mentions
   - `format_response(answer: str, sources: List[Source])` function to format answers with citations
2. Implement message extraction logic to parse queries from Slack messages
3. Connect to the retrieval pipeline to get answers
4. Format responses with proper citations and source links
5. Implement thread reply functionality
6. Add error handling for API failures and timeouts

# Test Strategy:
1. Test the bot responds to @sambaai mentions
2. Verify responses include proper citations
3. Confirm replies are posted in the correct thread
4. Test error handling by simulating API failures
5. Verify the bot handles different message formats correctly

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Mention Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: None

### Details:
Log errors, provide user-friendly error messages, and ensure system stability.

## 7. Comprehensive Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and execute tests covering all components, including unit, integration, and end-to-end scenarios for mention handling, parsing, retrieval, formatting, threading, and error cases.
### Details:
Automate tests where possible and document test coverage and results.
